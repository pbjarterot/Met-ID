# Met-ID
Metabolite identification in Mass Spectrometry Imaging.
Met-ID has been developed to automate metabolite identification in Mass Spectrometry Imaging, at the moment most of this is done manually by experts which in the world of high throughput studies is not feasable.

Met-ID has a particular focus on derivatizing matrices leading to other ions than the common [M+H]+ in positive mode and [M-H]- in negative mode. As [FMP-10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0551-3) was developed in house, it features heavily in the software, however, this is mostly to show the point at which to start as Met-ID is extendable to use any derivatizing matrix with the tools to do local version changes right from inside the software.

Met-ID also includes tools to study MS2 spectra, as a critical part of metabolite identification is to study MS2 spectra of unknown compounds and compare them to those generated by standard. The base version of Met-ID comes with a number of MS2 spectra collected from chemical standards with an FT-ICR using the FMP-10 chemical matrix. Met-ID allows the user to input MS2 spectra from unknown compounds to compare to standards and also ways to add user generated spectra from chemical standards to the database. It should be noted that all changes to the database only affect that specific install of Met-ID and not any other.



## How to Install
At the moment, we have yet to fix the automatic code signing of the software which means that they will have to be opened in unsafe mode, files to install Met-ID are located on the right hand side under "Releases" or can be found by clicking [here](https://github.com/pbjarterot/Met-ID/releases).

### Windows
To install Met-ID on Windows, download the .msi file found in releases and follow the instructions.

### MacOS
To install Met-ID on MacOS, download the .dmg file found in releases and follow the instructions.

### Linux (Debian systems, e.g. Ubuntu)
To install Met-ID on Debian systems, download the .deb file found in releases and follow the instructions.
